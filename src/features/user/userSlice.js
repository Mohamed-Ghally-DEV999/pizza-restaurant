/* 
So, in the context of the updateName reducer, state is specifically referring to the state of the "user" slice. This is different from the overall Redux store state, which might include other slices if you have multiple slices in your store. Each slice has its own state, and the updateName reducer is responsible for updating the state of the "user" slice.
